# SkiittzsAntiGrinderCheese

Prevents players from using hand held grinders and drills on enemy nonfunctional blocks (interior blocks, armor blocks, etc).  They will still work on functional blocks - so you can still hack your way through a ships interior by grinding down doors and such, but you wont be able to just tunnel straight through the armor.
